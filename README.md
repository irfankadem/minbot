# minbot
Developed a chatbot using TensorFlow and NLTK that processes user input through tokenization and lemmatization for intent classification. Utilized a bag of words approach to convert input into features for a neural network model to predict user intent. Mapped predictions to predefined responses stored in a JSON file to generate interactive conversations.
